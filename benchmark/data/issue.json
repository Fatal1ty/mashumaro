  "body": "Hello guys,\r\n\r\nI'm using _OpenCV_ in VSCode (Ubuntu Software installation) and everything worked fine, until I updated my libraries (`sudo apt-get update/upgrade/full-upgrade`) I guess. But now VSCode or rather _OpenCV_ can't find the _GTK_ library. \r\n\r\nI've tested this succesfully:\r\n `GTK_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0 ./test` --> works\r\n\r\nBut when I specify the version gtk-3.0:\r\n`GTK_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-3.0 ./test` --> fails\r\n\r\n Normally the loaded version without using GTK_PATH is gtk-3.0 and then it shows me this error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62354721/229435079-a85c5ff1-a8c3-4870-9340-bdc9404e595b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI verified that the in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-3.0/modules` is:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62354721/229059188-4171f730-d2d9-4b6c-b103-447ca8ee727b.png)\r\n\r\nWould appreciate to solve this warning and to understand why the .so cannot be loaded.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** the example code can be executed without warnings in the normal gnome terminal, but VSCode seems to habe problems to find the specific libraries, so it's definitely _VSCode_.",
